# Parliamentary Decision Log:
*This document logs the key decisions made regarding the analysis of parliamentary questions in the context of the thesis.*

## Decision: Why parliamentary questions (PQs) and not wider debates?
*date: 14/02/2026*
### Reason:
* Ireland uses PR-STV (Proportional Representation with Single Transferable Vote) where TD's are competing in not just against other parties, but also against fellow party members in the same constituency. 
This creates a strong incentive for TDs to cultivate a personal vote by responding to local issues and constituents concerns, making it a particularly interesting area of study when compared with online public discourse
### Alternative considered:
* Include wider debates in the analysis
### Alternative Rejected because:
* Broader legislative debates don't necessarily reflect public opinion in the same way as parliamentary questions, which are often more directly responsive to constituents' concerns due to the PR-STV electoral system.

## Decision: Why focus on a specific time period for the analysis of parliamentary questions?
* date: 14/02/2026*
### Reason:
* Focusing on 2025 allows us to focus on contemporary issues and public sentiment
### Alternative considered:
* Analyze parliamentary questions across multiple time periods
